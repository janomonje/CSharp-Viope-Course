In the final chapter of the course we put together everything we have learnt so far by creating a project called Movie Watch Log. As the name implies the software helps the user to keep track of the movies they have watched. Features include adding and deleting a movie, saving and loading the data to/from a storage media and showing a simple watch report.

In this exercise your task is to define Movie class, its fields and the constructor. The class must be serializable.

The class properties are Name, Length and Year and the constructor parameters are in the same order.


Example output:
Name: Robocop, length: 102min, year: 1987

Name: Robocop 2, length: 117min, year: 1990

Name: Robocop 3, length: 104min, year: 1993In the final chapter of the course we put together everything we have learnt so far by creating a project called Movie Watch Log.
